# Speed-Parkour-Game
Second long-term game that I worked, from early 2018 to mid 2018. The premise of this game was to quickly complete a set of 20 short one-screen levels in under ten seconds, using only controls to jump, move right and move left. Other features were added as well, such as a clock that could extend time. The game was eventually scrapped due to a poor code base, confusing/challenging game mechanics, and interest in another game idea (which would become Aliens and Arrows).
